# A Conceptual Basis for the Sensitivity Analysis of Financial Market Agent Based Models

This is my Bachelor Thesis from Bocconi University (Thesis supervisor: Emanuele Borgonovo, PhD.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on two goals: the analysis of the related literature and the outline of the theoretical structure of the model. For the former, there are two main areas of research: Financial Market Agent-Based Models (FM-ABMs) and Sensitivity Analysis. For the latter, we delineate a specific structure for the FM-ABM that serves as a study case for a six-step Sensitivity Analysis procedure. In particular, we assign each element of the model to 4 different categories: principles, assumptions, parameters, and procedures, and divide the last two categories into agent and non-Â­agent. Lastly, we add a non-parametric element to the model to broaden the scope of Sensitivity Analysis.
